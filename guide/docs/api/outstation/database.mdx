The `Database` class is used to manipulate the measurement types that the outstation exposes to the master. It is called a "database", but it is really just
a thread-safe data structure.

## Adding Points

Before the outstation exposes any measurement data, points must be initialized. This is typically done once during program initialization, but can support
adding points to a running outstation as well. Each measurement type has its own unique configuration except for Octet Strings which don't require any
configuration.

* Default static and event variations
* Type-specific dead-bands which default to zero (Binary points have no deadband)

When a point is added, it is given a default value with `RESTART` flags:

*  Binary points are set to `false`
*  Numeric values are set to `0`.
*  OctetStrings are given the value of `[0x00]`

You may also update the value right after adding the point if you don't want a connecting master to see `RESTART`.
