Rust has an excellent package manager called `cargo` that makes it easy to work with external dependencies. The downside to this capable tooling is that
Rust's open-source ecosystem tends to factor libraries quite finely, and the number of dependencies can grow quickly.

While this library only directly depends on a handful of 3rd party libraries, those libraries pull in dozens of sub-dependencies. Ensuring that all direct and
indirect dependencies are properly and legally used is important to us and our customers.

## Automated License Checking

To ensure that our binary distributions meet the legal requirements of 3rd party open source licenses, we have developed an automated tool called
`complicense` that performs the following tasks:

* Analyzes each dependency's license against an allowed list of licenses. Our CI packaging will fail if a dependency is added that is not allowed.
* Uses the Github API to automatically retrieve the license file for each project hosted on Github. Only a few projects don't have the proper metadata and the
license name and content are specified manually in the `complicense` configuration.
* Ignores projects that are 100% the copyright of Step Function I/O (e.g. the DNP3 library itself).
* Produces a license report document called `licenses.txt` that rolls up all of the dependency and license information. This document is then included
in all of our binary distributions for transparency and to meet the license requirements.

## Proprietary Compatible

All of library's dependencies use licenses that are compatible with commercial/proprietary products. We don't allow the incorporation of strong copyleft licenses
such as the GPL. All of the licenses in use are also compatible with each-other. You can see all of the allowed licenses in
[ffi/license_config.json](https://github.com/stepfunc/dnp3/blob/master/ffi/license_config.json).

## Licenses.txt

`Complicense` produces a verbose report called [licenses.txt](https://github.com/stepfunc/dnp3/blob/master/ffi/licenses.txt) that aggregates the following
information for each dependency:

* Unique name of the library (Rust crate)
* Repository URL at which the library is hosted
* Authors of the library as specified on [crates.io](https://crates.io/).
* Description of the library
* Name of the license(s) that apply to the crate
* Full license text including any copyright notices present

Some libraries choose to dual license under multiple licenses and give users the choice of which license to use. In this case the report only includes the text
of one of these licenses returned by the Github API.

## Disclaimer

This information and the provided `licenses.txt` do not constitute legal advice.  It is meant to be a starting point for library users to perform their own due
diligence and to demonstrate that open source license compliance is taken seriously.
