The `OutstationInformation` interface provides informational callbacks about the state of the outstation. They can be used to assess
communication health or counters of some sort. These callbacks don't provide any information that the outstations needs to operate and doing anything
useful with them is purely optional.

Among other things, user code can be informed when:

* The outstation receives a request using a particular function code
* A solicited or unsolicited confirmation timeout occurs
* A confirm arrives after the timeout or in the wrong state (`unexpectedConfirm`)
