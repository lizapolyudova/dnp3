The `Database` class is returned when allows users to manipulate the measurement types that the outstation exposes to the master. It is called a "database", but it is really just
a thread-safe data structure.  The database API is transactional. A lock is acquired whenever the user wishes to make a change, and then a number of changes can be
made together.
